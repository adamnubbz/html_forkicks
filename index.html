    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    
    <h4>Adam Hudson</h4>
    
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach<br>
      technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take<br>
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes<br>
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,<br>
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br>
      We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from<br>
      learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our<br>
