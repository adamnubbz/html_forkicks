    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <h4>Adam Hudson</h4>

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach<br>
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take<br> command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes<br> everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,<br> Googling error
        messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br> We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from<br> learning technical sophistication, probably more.
